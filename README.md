# CS-305-Software-Security

Artemis Financial is my client's financial consulting firm that required increased security measures for their web application. I was tasked with conducting a vulnerability assessment for the company that would provide knowledge to patch any vulnerabilities found and demonstrate the best practices for secure data management and communication.


I managed to discover vulnerabilities that could lead to the compromised security of sensitive information, and utilize secure coding practices such as encryption, input validation, and HTTPS use were probably one of the most important portions of the vulnerability assessment project because it is required to secure sensitive information on their web application and in turn, maintain the client's trust.


An aspect of the web application project involved using security tools in a suitable measure that informed my ideas on how vulnerability assessments, risk assessing, and mitigating could all be managed together. After a period of refactoring code, I explicitly verified that the web application was functional and secure through dependency checks and testing measures.


The project illustrates my capacity to conduct vulnerability assessments, securely code, and ensure reliability for a software product; all important skills that would be beneficial for other software development roles in the future.
